# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Manjila Moktan

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about data science, AI, and building tools that solve real-world problems. Here are a couple of projects I've worked on:

- ðŸ”§ [Reddit Subreddit Classifier]([https://github.com/manjilam/NLP-reddit-calssification]): A natural language processing project that predicts whether a Reddit post belongs to the Minimalism or Declutter subreddit using TF-IDF and classification models.

- ðŸŒ¿ [SF Crime Modeling]([(https://github.com/manjilam/SF-crime-modeling)): A machine-learning model that uses location, time, and incident metadata to flag at least 80 percent of high-priority 911 calls in real time, enabling law enforcement agencies to meet their goal of response time.



Thanks for stopping by â€” more projects coming soon!
